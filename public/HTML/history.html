        For more than 75 years, Mocha Glaze has been more than just a morning treat. It's been a tradition, a gathering place, and an obsession for those who know a good thing when they taste it.

    <h2>How did we start?</h2>
    <p class="text">
        In 1948, two lifelong friends asked themselves: What can we do to make Mocha Glaze stand out?<br>
        Their idea for the donuts was to replace ordinary flour with <strong>potato flour</strong>, making the donuts lighter, fluffier, and softer.  
        For their coffee, they revived a <strong>heritage brewing technique</strong> passed down for generations, which brings out rich, hidden flavors in every cup.

    <h2>New Owners, Same Traditions</h2>
    <p class="text">
        Fast forward to today, and while ownership has changed hands, one thing hasn't: our commitment to making Donuts & Coffee the same way they've always been made. No shortcuts. No messing with the recipe. Just the same fluffy, melt-in-your-mouth goodness and that special brewing method that's kept people coming back for generations.
